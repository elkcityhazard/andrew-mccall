# Micro Processor

A microprocessor is a very small machine. It works in tandem with electrical inputs that we give instructions to. It speaks a language and they are not all the same and do not speak the same langauge.

## Instructions

There is a variety of languages that microprocessors works

### Types of languages

- IA-32
- x86-64
- ARM
- MIPS

Micro processors are machines that accept instructions. These instructions are called machine code.

## Machine Code

Definition: Programming Languages spoken by computer processors

Evey program you run on your computer has been converted (compiled) into machine code.

### Levels Of Abstraction

- Machine Language (Low Level Programming)
- Assembly Language
- C/C++
- Javascript (High Level Programming)

Modern Developers sit very far away from low level programming like machine language because Javascript doesn't concern itself with things like memory.

Node itself is a C++ program. Also, V8 is written in C++.
