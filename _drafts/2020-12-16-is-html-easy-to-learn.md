## What is HTML?

HTML stands for Hypertext Markup Language.  Personally, I started writing HTML in 1998.  HTML was created in 1991 but it wasn't until 1995 that it became common place.  Since its introduction, there has been five versions introduced.  The most current version being HTML 5 which was introduced in 2012.

The HTML title tag has a greater purpose than just showing the title of the document, however.
