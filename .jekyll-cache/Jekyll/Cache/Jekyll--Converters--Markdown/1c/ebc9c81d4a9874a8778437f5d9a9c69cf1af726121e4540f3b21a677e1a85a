Since its introduction, there has been five versions introduced.  The most current version being HTML 5 which was introduced in 2012.  In the 1990‚Äôs communication technology was increasing at a rapid pace.  As the foundation for the world wide web was being laid, there became a need to share information.  Web browsers were a new technology and HTML was the language used to communicate through the browser.  It has since stuck as the defacto language of the web browser.</p>

<p>Hypertext is simply text that is connected through linking to another document.  It usually has a contextual clue to what the connected document contains.  For example, it might be as simple as the title of the connected document, or contextual keywords that help describe what the document is.  For Example: <a href="https://andrew-mccall.com">Home Page</a> or <a href="https://andrew-mccall.com/contact.html">This is a link to the contact page</a></p>

<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">&lt;html&gt;</code> 
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">&lt;head&gt;</code> 
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">&lt;title&gt; Title Here &lt;/title&gt;</code> 
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">&lt;/head&gt;</code>

<p>The title tag simply establishes the title of the document.  You will see it displayed at the top bar of the page at the very top of browser window.  The HTML title tag has a greater purpose than just showing the title of the document, however.  This HTML title tag will be used to give search engines a semantically rich title which will help people find your page in search engines.
