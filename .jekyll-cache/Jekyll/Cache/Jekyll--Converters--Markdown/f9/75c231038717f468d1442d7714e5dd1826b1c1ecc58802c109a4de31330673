<p>The site is designed to be simple for the client/owner.  The client did not want to spend a lot of time maintaining updates.  They more or less wanted a brochure style website that could help increase their brand and have a professional landing page on the internet.</p>

<p>Javascript was used to configure the mobile menu, add in some lazy loading, and also validate the contact form.</p>
