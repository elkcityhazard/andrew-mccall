<p>A microprocessor is a very small machine. It works in tandem with electrical inputs that we give instructions to. It speaks a language and they are not all the same and do not speak the same langauge.</p>

<h2 id="instructions">Instructions</h2>

<p>There is a variety of languages that microprocessors works</p>

<h3 id="types-of-languages">Types of languages</h3>

<ul>
  <li>IA-32</li>
  <li>x86-64</li>
  <li>ARM</li>
  <li>MIPS</li>
</ul>

<p>Micro processors are machines that accept instructions. These instructions are called machine code.</p>

<h2 id="machine-code">Machine Code</h2>

<p>Definition: Programming Languages spoken by computer processors</p>

<p>Evey program you run on your computer has been converted (compiled) into machine code.</p>

<h3 id="levels-of-abstraction">Levels Of Abstraction</h3>

<ul>
  <li>Machine Language (Low Level Programming)</li>
  <li>Assembly Language</li>
  <li>C/C++</li>
  <li>Javascript (High Level Programming)</li>
</ul>

<p>Modern Developers sit very far away from low level programming like machine language because Javascript doesnâ€™t concern itself with things like memory.</p>

<p>Node itself is a C++ program. Also, V8 is written in C++.</p>
